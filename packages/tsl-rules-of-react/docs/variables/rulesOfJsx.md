[tsl-rules-of-react](../README.md) / rulesOfJsx

# Variable: rulesOfJsx()

```ts
const rulesOfJsx: (options?: "off") => Rule<unknown>;
```

TS checks for most of the issues described at https://react.dev/learn/writing-markup-with-jsx#the-rules-of-jsx
by default, so there isn't much for us to implement.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type |
| ------ | ------ |
| `options?` | `"off"` |

## Returns

`Rule`\<`unknown`\>
